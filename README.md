# Cloudflare SDK

## Description
This project is an SDK (Software Development Kit) for interacting with the Cloudflare API. It provides a set of classes and methods that allow you to programmatically manage your Cloudflare services.

## Project Tree
- `src/` : Contains the source code of the Cloudflare SDK.
- `tests/` : Contains unit tests for the SDK.
- `vendor/` : Contains the dependencies installed via Composer.
- `phpunit.xml` : PHPUnit configuration file.
- `composer.json` : Composer configuration file.
- `README.md` : This file.

## Requirements
- PHP 7.0 or higher
- Composer (for managing dependencies)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/monzerfoda/cloudflare-sdk.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd cloudflare-sdk`
3. Install dependencies using Composer: `composer install`

## Usage
1. Include the Cloudflare SDK in your PHP project:
    ```php
    require_once 'path/to/cloudflare-sdk/autoload.php';
    ```
2. Set up the necessary API credentials:
    ```php
    use Cloudflare\API\Auth\APIKey;

    $email = 'your_email@example.com';
    $apiKey = 'your_api_key';
    $adapter = new APIKey($email, $apiKey);
    ```
3. Create an instance of the desired Cloudflare API class:
    ```php
    use Cloudflare\API\Endpoints\Zone;

    $zone = new Zone($adapter);
    ```
4. Use the methods provided by the API class to interact with Cloudflare services. Example:
    ```php
    // Get zone details
    $zoneId = 'your_zone_id';
    $zoneDetails = $zone->getZoneDetails($zoneId);

    // Perform actions based on the retrieved data
    echo 'Zone Name: ' . $zoneDetails->name;
    ```
